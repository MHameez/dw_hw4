    Yes. We are referring to **Bohemian Rhapsody** by

    According to the NPO radio rankingâ€™s in the Netherlands **Bohemian Rhapsody** along with a 
    few other tracks such **Hotel California** and **Imagine** stands in the top three rankings of the billboard from 1999 to 2019. 
    Interestingly, these are all Rock songs released before 1990. Does this mean that old music is better, or is new music 
    not as great? Looks like we will have to dig deep to find answers to this phenomenon.
