    Why is a 40+ years old song still topping the billboard charts today? Yes. We are referring to Bohemian Rhapsody by 
    the famous British Rock band Queen. According to the Billboard rankingâ€™s in the Netherlands Bohemian along with a 
    few other tracks such Hotel California and Imagine stands in the top three rankings of the billboard from 1999 to 2019. 
    Interestingly those are all Rock songs released before 1990. Does this mean that old music is better, or is new music 
    not as great? Looks like we will have to dig deep to find answers to this phenomenon.
